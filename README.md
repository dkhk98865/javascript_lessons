Collection of JavaScript Code Examples That Helps To Learn JavaScript

For 01_helloWorld to 08_removeFromArray: install Jest.
    - After cloning this repository to your local machine and installing NPM, go into the newly created directory (cd javascript exercises) and run npm install. This will install Jest and set up the testing platform based on our preconfigured setting. (Note: if you get warnings that packages are out of date or contanin vulnerabilities, you can safely ignore them for these exercises.)
    - to complete an exercise, you will need to go to the exercise directory with cd exerciseName in the terminal and run npm test exerciseName.spec.js. This should run the test file and show you the output. When you run a test for the first time, it will fail. This is by design! You must open the exercise file and write the code needed to get the test to pass.
    - Some of the exercises have test conditions defined in their spec file as test.skip instead of test. This is intentional. Once all test s pass, you will change the next test.skip to test and test your code again. You will do this until all conditions are satisfied. All tests must pass at the same time, and you should not have any instances of test.skip in the spec file when you are finished with an exercise.
